# Stonks
## A game of capitalism, and stocks, of course.

### Introduction
This game is a ***non-working*** prototype of a game inspired by a tabletop game of the same name. This project is NOT intended to infringe any copyrights and instead is merely a personal learning project to model an already existing game and port it into a C++ version.

### Running
To compile, you must have a C++20-compatible compiler installed on your machine. See Makefile for more details.
